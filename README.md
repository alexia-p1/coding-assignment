Assignment for "Coding for Economists" course

Imported data from https://osf.io/4e6d8/files/y6jvb

For the Stata exercise, running the master.do file (which contains the reading and working .do files) and substituting directories where needed should suffice.

For the Python exercise, the python_work.py (and, again, replacing directories) includes all necessary code.

For more information regarding the process of adding files into the repository, I have also uploaded the history when working with Git.
